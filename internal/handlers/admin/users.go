// TODO - CRUD for users, well, user configuration and sourcing
// Users will be defined by the storage (DB, AD), but there will be
// configuration options for users and the source itself. We may do
// JIT or proactive provisioning. May also expose API endpoints to
// enable an IDM to manage users. And/or SCIM.
